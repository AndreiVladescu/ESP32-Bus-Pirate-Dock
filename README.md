# ESP32-Bus-Pirate-Dock

Open-source carrier board for the Espressif ESP32-S3 DevKit, designed to complement the [ESP32-Bus-Pirate](https://github.com/geo-tp/ESP32-Bus-Pirate) project.

## Overview

ESP32-Bus-Pirate-Dock is a hardware dock/carrier board for the ESP32-S3 DevKit. It provides level and voltage translation between the 3.3V ESP32-S3 and external peripherals, with support for 1.8V, 3.3V, and 5V operation.

The design is intended to work with original ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, as well as the wider devkit clones from third party suppliers.

## Hardware status

Current hardware revision: V3

The markings on the PCB for the serial number `V0-YYWW-XXXXX` are as follows: 
- version `0`
- year and week number when these PCBs were produced
- incrementing number of the current batch

An example PCB with these markings would be `V3-2613-00512`, where:
- version number is `3`
- the year is `2026`, and the week is `13`
- this is the `512th` PCB made in that respective week

## Repository contents

- `dock/kicad/` — KiCad design files
- `dock/gerbers/` — PCB fabrication outputs
- `dock/schematic.pdf` — exported schematic reference
- `dock/BOM.csv` — bill of materials
- `3d_models/` — 3D models for the dock and a WIP case
- `images/` — presentation images

## Open-source scope

This repository open-sources the dock hardware design, including:
- schematic and PCB layout source files
- fabrication outputs
- bill of materials
- project documentation and images included in this repository

## Required external parts

This project requires an **ESP32-S3 DevKit to be procured separately by the end user**.

The ESP32-S3 DevKit is a third-party board/module and is **not included** as part of this hardware design repository unless explicitly stated. Vendor silicon, datasheets, trademarks, and separately licensed third-party materials remain the property of their respective owners.

These boards can be acquired through the official Espressif manufacturer and it's stores, or through other third-party websites. If not buying a genuine one,
make sure the dimensions fit one of the header pins on the board.

## Manufacturing and assembly

To fabricate the PCB, use the files in `dock/gerbers/`.

To inspect or modify the design, use the original KiCad source files in `dock/kicad/`.

To source components, use `dock/BOM.csv`.

## Case Design

The case for the ESP32 Bus Pirate Dock is still a work in progress. The current design uses two pieces, which can be printed using an FDM printer with
a 0.4 nozzle.
